## üì¶ Dependencies

Ensure these resources are installed and started before rex-townhall:

- **[rsg-core](https://github.com/Rexshack-RedM/rsg-core)** - Core framework (Required)
- **[rsg-multijob](https://github.com/Rexshack-RedM/rsg-multijob)** - Multi-job system (Required)
- **[ox_lib](https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib)** - UI library (Required)

## üöÄ Installation

### Step 1: Download
Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/yourusername/rex-townhall/releases) or clone this repository.

### Step 2: Extract
Extract the `rex-townhall` folder to your server's `resources` directory.

```
server/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ resources/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ rex-townhall/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ client/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ server/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ locales/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.lua
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fxmanifest.lua
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
```

### Step 3: Configure Jobs
Edit `config.lua` to add your server's specific jobs. Make sure these jobs exist in your `rsg-core/shared/jobs.lua`:

```lua
Config.Jobs = {
    { 
        title = 'Job Title',
        description = 'Job description',
        icon = 'fa-solid fa-icon-name',
        job = 'jobname',  -- Must match rsg-core job name
        grade = 1,
        jobcost = 5,
        jobitems = {  -- Optional: Items given when taking the job
            { item = 'item_name', amount = 1 },  -- Item must exist in rsg-core/shared/items.lua
        },
        arrow = true
    },
}
```

**Important Notes:**
- Job names must match exactly with jobs defined in `rsg-core/shared/jobs.lua`
- Item names in `jobitems` must exist in `rsg-core/shared/items.lua` or they will be skipped
- Invalid items will be logged to console but won't break the job application

### Step 4: Add to server.cfg
Add the following line to your `server.cfg`:

```cfg
ensure rex-townhall
```

**Important:** Make sure dependencies are loaded first:
```cfg
ensure rsg-core
ensure rsg-multijob
ensure ox_lib
ensure rex-townhall
```

### Step 5: Restart Server
Restart your server or use the command:
```
refresh
start rex-townhall
```

        npcmodel = 'model_name',
        npccoords = vector4(x, y, z, heading),
        location = 'location_identifier',
        blipname = 'Blip Name',

### Getting Help
- **Discord**: [Join our Discord](https://discord.gg/YUV7ebzkqs)
- **YouTube**: [RexShack Gaming](https://www.youtube.com/@rexshack/videos)
- **Issues**: [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/yourusername/rex-townhall/issues)

### Common Issues

**Problem**: "You have too many jobs already!"
- **Solution**: This means you've reached the multi-job limit configured in rsg-multijob. Resign from a job first or ask an administrator to increase your job limit.

**Problem**: NPCs not spawning
- **Solution**: Check that NPC models are valid for RedM and coordinates are correct.

**Problem**: Jobs not appearing in menu
- **Solution**: Verify that job names in config.lua match those in rsg-core/shared/jobs.lua.

**Problem**: Cooldown not working
- **Solution**: The cooldown is client-side and resets on resource restart or player reconnect.

**Problem**: Players not receiving starting items
- **Solution**: Check the server console for errors. Items must exist in `rsg-core/shared/items.lua`. The script will skip invalid items and log an error.

**Problem**: Players bypassing job limits
- **Solution**: This should not be possible as of v2.1.1. Both client and server validate against rsg-multijob limits. If this occurs, report it as a bug.
