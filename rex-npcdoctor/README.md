    -- Your custom heal logic
end)

AddEventHandler('rex-npcdoctor:client:revive', function()
    -- Your custom revive logic
end)
```

Change event names in config:

```lua
Config.Events = {
    Heal = 'your-resource:heal',
    Revive = 'your-resource:revive',
}
```

#### Server Events

**rex-npcdoctor:server:charge**
- Parameters: `amount` (number), `actionType` (string)
- Charges player for medical services

**rex-npcdoctor:server:purchaseItem**
- Parameters: `item` (table)

## Troubleshooting

### Doctor NPCs not spawning

- Check console for model loading errors
- Verify coordinates are correct for your map

### Payment not working
- Confirm `Config.ChargeOnServer = true`
- Check player has sufficient funds
- Verify `Config.MoneyAccount` matches your economy setup

### Discord logs not appearing
- Verify webhook URL is correct and not deleted
- Ensure `Config.EnableDiscordLogs = true`
- Check webhook channel still exists
- Test webhook with a Discord webhook tester

### Blips not showing
- Ensure resource is started after rsg-core
- Check that blip sprites are valid for RedM
